A program created using SWING library. This program spawns chickens, foxes and seed in random locations at the beginning of the simulation.
In the first iteration chickens move around the maze to find seed. Once a chicken finds a seed, it's health regenerates (if chicken comes 
by a fox it loses health and gains experience, it also loses health etery step it takes) and it also gains experience. To calculate gained 
knowledge I used Q-learning algorithm. At the end of the first iteration (after all chickens die) time of lifespan is measured.
Next iterations respawn all things in the same place and the process of experience gaining continues. After 100 iterations chickens stop 
exploring and start exploiting based on the knowledge they acquired. Then the user can stop the simulation and compare the time of 
lifespan of chickens in first and last iterations to see if Q-learning algorithm helped them survive longer.
